It offers a proprietary live-streaming and archiving solution to conferences, lecture series, book fairs and individual podcasters, as well as place for listeners to find thousands of hours of interesting content. Notable appearances on the platform include <strong>Edward Snowden</strong>, <strong>Slawoj Zizek</strong> and <strong>Angela Merkel</strong>.

It lacked cohesion and features were competing with each other for attention.</p><img src="/nickniles/assets/img/vr/talk-page-old-listen.jpg" alt="Voice Republic"/><p class="caption">The "Talk" page before the redesign</p><p>At the same time, the team was pivoting away from a collaborative-stage model&mdash;where listeners could request the microphone&mdash;to more of a traditional live-broadcast model. They asked me to join the team in order to give the design a refresh and ensure that all the new features would cohere to the new design.
</p><h2>The Redesign</h2><p>We went through lots of different shenanigans...

</p><img src="/nickniles/assets/img/vr/talk-page-early-design.jpg" alt="Voice Republic"/><p class="caption">An early design mockup</p><p>As Head of Product Design at Voice Republic, my role included the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Strategy</strong>: I consult the key stakeholders on design and UX enhancements. I work closely with the developers to ensure that design suggestions are realistic to build within the given resources.</li><li><strong>Workshops</strong>: Occasionally I lead design workshops to gather requirements and brainstorm solutions.</li><li><strong>UX</strong>: I create wireframes and mockups for new features and apps.</li><li><strong>Interaction Design & Prototyping</strong>: I deliver browser-based prototypes of each new feature for validation, testing and documentation.</li><li><strong>Front-End</strong>: I implement the designs using HAML, JQuery, Rails, SCSS and Clojurescript.
</li></ul><p>The Voice Republic site is constantly changing. And with such a small team, it's hard to accomplish even a portion of the things on our roadmap. But I'm happy with lots of the improvements we've made to the UX and design.
