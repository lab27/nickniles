_Why is it so hard for me to start a blog?_ I'll tell you why: **Personas.** 

Here's what I mean: Let's say I'm on Facebook and I see a silly post by a friend. Let's say this friend is someone I know from college and we still cling to a dude-like vernacular that we shared when we were barely adult. I might be tempted to post a response to his post by saying something that I know he'll find amusing.

* Peronas: what I mean and what ,my propblem is.
