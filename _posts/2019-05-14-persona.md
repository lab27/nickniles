_Why was it so hard for me to start a blog?_ I'll tell you why: **Personas.** 

Here's what I mean: Let's say I'm on Facebook, and I see a silly post by an old college friend. Let's say this friend and I still cling to a juvenile, dude-like vernacular that we shared in the old days. Mind you, this is just an example. I would never use juvenile language anymore. But for the sake of argument: let's say I'm tempted to post a juvenile comment that I know he'll find amusing.

You're such a burpsicle. Ha. Then what happens is: before I hit <enter> I think for a second about all the  people on Facebook _other_ than Friend McDuderson who might see this post. Work colleagues? Students? Parents? Grandparents?

Do I want _all_ those people to see the juvenile side of me?
