(TODO: persona-spoof image)

*Why is it so hard to start a blog?*

I'll tell you why it is for me: I have this problem with **Personas.** Here's what I mean: I'll see a friend's post on Facebook. Let's say this is a friend from college, with whom I share a particular "dude-like" vernacular. I might be tempted to post a response to his post by saying something that I know he'll find amusing (TODO: example?? fake screenshot?). But before I click "post" I think about what it will be liek for all the other people i know of facebook to see that post. What will my work colleagues think about it? What will my mom think?

This is a problem I have.
